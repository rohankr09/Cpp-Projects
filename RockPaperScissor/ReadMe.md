This C++ code implements a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game that allows a player to play against the computer. It uses various C++ concepts and features, including:

**1) Random Number Generation:** The srand(time(0)) and rand() functions are used to generate a random choice for the computer.

**2) Variables and Arithmetic Operations:** Integer variables (player_score, computer_score, rounds, player_choice, computer_choice, roundtime) are used to keep track of scores, rounds, and choices. Arithmetic operations are used to calculate the scores and determine the winner.

**3) Clearing the Console:** system("cls") is used to clear the console screen between rounds.

**4) Keyboard Input:** getch() from the <conio.h> library is used to pause the program and wait for a keypress before proceeding to next round.

**5) Game Logic:** The code implements the game rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors and keeps track of scores and rounds.


Overall, this code demonstrates basic C++ concepts, including input/output, conditional statements, loops, random number generation, and arithmetic operations.

Here are some screenshots of the program after executing in the terminal.


In the beginning the program asks some basics information along with no. of rounds user wants to play.
Here I've given 3 as input in rounds to play. So, it'll execute till 3 rounds during the whole game..
